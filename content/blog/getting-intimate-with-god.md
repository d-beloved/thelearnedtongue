Matt. 22:37-38 TPT: *Jesus answered him, **"Love the Lord your God with every passion of your heart, with all the energy of your being, and with every thought that is within you." This is the great and supreme commandment.***

It's obvious that the greatest defining factor of everything in our lives is our relationship with God. We've also seen that love is a major resource in any relationship. Since we can't see God physically to hold His hands, look into His eyes, or visit His house, how do we love HIm?

First of all, love is not a feeling. It is a commitment. It is not words, it's actions. **Thus, our love for God cannot primarily be measured by what we feel inside or what we say. It starts from the point of salvation.** You can't love Him if you haven't acknowledged His love for you. **We love Him because He first loved us.** I Jn. 4:19.

Salvation is not primarily to escape hell. It's first to acknowledge the love of the One who went all the way to give Himself to death on our behalf, even when we were yet sinners.

Rom.5:7-8 TPT: *Now, who of us would dare to die for the sake of a wicked person? We can all understand if someone was willing to die for a truly noble person. **But Christ proved Godâ€™s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly!***

Are you saved? Does the Spirit bear witness with your spirit that you're God's? Why did you come to Jesus? Is it just to escape hell and condemnation? Do you believe that He loves you? Are you still plagued with the mistakes you've made? Do you believe in the forgiveness His love provides?

To settle every doubt, **God loves You**. His love is unexplainable to man. Little wonder David exclaimed, "What is man that You're mindful of Him?" Psalm 8:4

What next after coming to the point of salvation? It's time to build a relationship. It's time to know the One you've come to accept to be your Lord and Savior.

A major proof of your love for something or someone is the time you give to it/them, both in your thoughts and in the physical. One major thing that should have stuck with you is that **you must be intentional**. It's starts from within.

When we make a chart of what occupies your mind in the 24-hour day that we have, and we struggle to find God, then, the love you profess to have is questionable. Jesus, while on earth, knew this and said, "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; **but their heart is far from me**." Matt. 15:8

There's great need to consistently keep your focus on God as you engage in your daily activities and make your everyday decisions. It starts from your time alone with Him, whether morning, afternoon, or night. It's imperative to dedicate a time to consistently meet your Lover alone.

Just like every meeting with a friend creates a memory and keeps you looking forward to more, the time you spend with God in your closet has a way of conditioning your mind as you go through the day. How frequent have you been meeting with your Father, Lover, and Lord?
