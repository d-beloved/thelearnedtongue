Another major evidence of quality fellowship with the Lord is that we cease to live for ourselves alone. We begin to live for Him alone, and through that, we become channels through which He reaches other men.

Gal. 2:20 TPT: *My old identity has been co-crucified with Messiah and no longer lives; for the nails of his cross crucified me with him. **And now the essence of this new life is no longer mine, for the Anointed One lives his life through me** —we live in union as one!...*

Like we've seen previously, it's a living and loving relationship with the Lord, thus, a true partner will also seek to contribute his/her own quota to the relationship. **What have you done for the Lord? And what are you doing for Him? Much more, what are you willing to do for Him?**

It's humbling to know that the Almighty needs you and I, as men living on earth to carry out His purposes. Yes, He could use anyone, but He chose us before time began. Won't we be unwise to live in ignorance of this truth? Do you think you're just here to fill up the number of people on earth?

There's a reason for your existence. There's a purpose for your knowing the Lord. There's a result that should flow out of your fellowship with God. It is such that you begin to yield to Him to do with you whatever He pleases. Though He chose you earlier, He still won't force you. He wants a willing surrender, and thus, keeps asking you, like He asked in the presence of Prophet Isaiah: *... “Whom shall I send as a messenger to my people? Who will go?”...* Isa. 6:8

Matt. 16:24: *Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to be My disciple, let him deny himself \[disregard, lose sight of, and forget himself and his own interests] and take up his cross and follow Me \[cleave steadfastly to Me, conform wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying, also].*

What are those things hindering you from fully answering the call of God for your life? The call of God is not primarily about the call to be a pastor or evangelist. **The call of God is a call to do His will at all times and in all places. It's a call to represent the Lord wherever you're found, and wherever He assigns you to. It's a call to bring men to the light.**

2 Cor. 5:20: ***So we are Christ’s ambassadors, God making His appeal as it were through us. We \[as Christ’s personal representatives]** beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor \[now offered you] and be reconciled to God.*

If you ever said "Yes" to Jesus, then I'm glad to inform you that you have lost the right to dictate your own life. Choosing your career path, your location, your friends, your fiance, etc. based on what you want, without consulting God, paints a picture of a servant trying to run his master's home.

The earlier the better my brother, my sister. The days are running by. The end of the time is upon us. Many have trodden the path of self and are full of regrets today. What will you do? **The fulfillment you seek will only be found in doing the Father's bidding.**

Don't be afraid of making mistakes at the initial stages of your seeking God. Instead, be quick to rise up after every fall, and be determined and work towards not making the same mistake again. **The more we learn, the more we know, and the more we know is the more we'll want to know.** We never get to a place of Independence in our walk with God. In fact, **the sign of growth is how dependent you've become on the Holy Spirit for any and every thing.**

Remember that you were bought with a price, and not just any price, **you were bought with the blood of Jesus Christ. What will you bring to Him; Profit or Loss?**

***And now just as you trusted Christ to save you, trust him, too, for each day’s problems; live in vital union with him. Let your roots grow down into him and draw up nourishment from him. See that you go on growing in the Lord, and become strong and vigorous in the truth you were taught. Let your lives overflow with joy and thanksgiving for all he has done. Don’t let others spoil your faith and joy with their philosophies, their wrong and shallow answers built on men’s thoughts and ideas, instead of on what Christ has said.*** Col. 2:6-8
