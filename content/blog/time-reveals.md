...how much attention we're paying to our lives;
...how keen we are about building good relationships;
...the quality and quantity of seeds we're sowing in different things and at different times;
...if we're getting better or living in the past;
...the growth process we're allowing our values and principles to go through;
...what and what have become strongholds in our existence;
... actions that we have allowed to become habits, whether good or bad;
...our value for life and living;
... If God is our God, or other things have taken His place; and ultimately,
...which side of eternity we will end up with our day-to-day actions.
