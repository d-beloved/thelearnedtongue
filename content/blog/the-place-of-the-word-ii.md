title: The Place of the Word (II)
description: You're responsible for whatever outcome your life gives. And you
  can't carry out that responsibility without rightly appropriating and
  enforcing the Words of God; in your heart first, then in your mouth and
  actions.

I﻿n the [previous article](https://thelearnedtongue.com/blog/the-place-of-the-word-i/) we talked about the place of the Word of God in any life.

For today, we'll be looking at "The Place of the Word of God in your mouth."
*Faith empowers us to see that the universe was created and beautifully coordinated by the power of God’s words! He spoke and the invisible realm gave birth to all that is seen.*
Hebrews 11:3

*There’s only one kind of person who is worse than a fool: the impetuous one who speaks without thinking first.* Proverbs 29:20

Previously,  we said the Word of God is:  

1. To understand what exists, and
2. To bring to bear what should exist.

Now, for number 2 to be done, we must also understand and rightly appropriate the place of the Word of God in our mouths. 

It is one thing to sew a dress for you, it is another thing for you to wear it correctly and carry it with dignity. Thus, every compliment on how you look will be an added advantage and not a need. However, if you wear it wrongly or are not sure of how it fits you (and have a doubt about it already), no matter how beautiful the dress is and was made, you'll take note of everything said by everyone. The good/the bad...because you yourself are in doubt.

If you've not come to believe the Words God has spoken via His written word, directly to you, or via other persons, you won't be able to frame your world according to what God has purposed. 

If God framed the world with His words, then the part of the world we exist in must be framed with His words in our mouths. 

What is God saying concerning your daily living, family, career, children, neighbourhood, health, finance, etc.??? Do you know???
If you don't, go and seek Him via His words and prayers.
If you do, have you been enforcing those words? Or have you allowed the crowd mentality to rob you of the efficacy of the Word? 
Do you now use slang/words foolishly (like "Sapa wan kill me", "This Nigeria dey hard", "Mo daran", "Wahala", etc.)? 
Do you doubt those words with your actions? (E.g. You say God has not given me the spirit of fear, but you've allowed that spirit to feast in your life.)

The Words of God must flow ceaselessly from your heart to your mouth. Salt and Fresh water shouldn't come from the same source. 

I'll end with this: You're responsible for whatever outcome your life gives. And you can't carry out that responsibility without rightly appropriating and enforcing the Words of God; in your heart first, then in your mouth and actions.

The Lord is our help!
