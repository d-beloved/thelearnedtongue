Work is something produced or accomplished by effort, exertion, or exercise of skill. (Merriam Webster dictionary).

Our work for God captures everything we do for God. The preposition "for" shows that the work we are talking about here is anything produced or accomplished by effort, exertion, or exercise of skill, with God or His pleasure as the goal.  It is whatever we do, as a result of our knowledge of God... It includes several things like evangelism, giving, serving in a capacity or the other in the body, intercession for men, teaching, preaching, singing, ushering, etc.

We can't claim to walk with someone, and not be willing to do anything for the person. In the same way, you can't claim to love God, walk with Him, and have nothing in your hands to do as an assignment. What do you currently do for God? A very good sign of a healthy walk with God is how well He can trust you to commit men and things into your hands. It is important to point out clearly here, that working for God is not exclusively about being on the pulpit.

As the major ingredient required to aid our walk with God is AGREEMENT (check the blog on “Walking with God”), the major ingredient that aids our work for God, such that it's effective and pleasing to Him, is OBEDIENCE.
1 Sam. 15:22: Samuel said, Has the Lord as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

If we check through the scriptures, we'll see obedience in mighty men like Noah, Moses, David, etc. that did wonderful works from God. We see that when they were completely obedient to the details given to them by God, there was a "well-done", and when they didn’t, there was a spanking. God is no respecter of persons! The closer you walk with God, the more Obedience He requires in your work for Him. A vivid example of this is what happened to Moses when he smote the rock, instead of speaking to it (Numbers 20). 

We must be careful not to run, or do God's work with disobedience or while following the traditions of men. Mk. 7:8-13. Don't do it like it was done before, or like your friends do it, or like you did it in the past, or in the manner men want. Listen to His details, and follow them.

Deuteronomy 28:1-2:  “Now it shall be, if you diligently listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all of His commandments which I am commanding you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. 2 All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you pay attention to the voice of the LORD your God.

In working for God, great care must be taken to ensure that our work doesn't overshadow our walk. There's no excuse for allowing what you do for God shrink your walk with Him. It's our duty to daily prioritize our walk with God over our work for Him. We are expected to get to a point where we'll rather spend days alone with Him, than spend an hour in front of a mighty crowd.

Actually, it's the priority we place on our walk with God that validates our work for Him. The work just flows without struggle, with more impact, because truly, it's neither by power nor by might, it's by the Spirit. Zech. 4:6. The arm of flesh will always fail, only that which has the breath of the Almighty has life and gives life to men.

David, a king, a warrior, who had duties to perform, was still the one longing to spend more and more time, just loving the Father. Our fathers of faith, despite their busy schedules still create time to gaze upon the Father. No wonder results for effortlessly. What is your excuse???

Psalm 27:4 TPT: Here’s the one thing I crave from God, the one thing I seek above all else: I want the privilege of living with him every moment in his house, finding the sweet loveliness of his face, filled with awe, delighting in his glory and grace. I want to live my life so close to him that he takes pleasure in my every prayer.

It's the Walk, then, the Work, not the other way round... Our intercession should flow from the place of relationship, where we can accurately hear the heartbeat of the Father, and lovingly hold His hands till His kingdom comes, and His will is done on earth... The same applies to preaching, teaching, evangelism, ushering, singing, etc. It's the audience of One that matters...

In conclusion, the strength for your work for God lies in your walk with God.
