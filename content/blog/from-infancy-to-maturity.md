Dealing with an infant/toddler can be quite full; full of every kind of emotion. You can go from being calm to being upset to getting angry to happy to sad to anxious to frustrated...the list is endless and what makes it more interesting is that all those emotions happen in a 24-hour day. (Note: Fathers and Mothers with an infant/toddler deserve hugs, biko).

As interesting and full as this period is, no parent desires that a child remains an infant/toddler. Rather, we celebrate growth. We look forward to when the baby stops being selfish (wanting the world to revolve around him/her, being unable to assist with things, repeatedly repeating the disobedience you just punished them for...) to when he/she begins to learn responsibility, social skills, good communication skills, etc. A child that refuses to show growth traits becomes a serious concern for the parents and must be seen by a Specialist.

It recently dawned on me that I was an infant when Christ saved me. I gave Him all sorts of work in a single hour but He instructed that I desire the sincere milk of the Word, as a newborn babe, that I may grow thereby (I Peter 2:2). 

God, just like every other parent, keeps looking out for me, giving me the needed nutrients and attention all in a bid to see me grow. He is waiting to see that I get to the point where by reason of use, I can discern between good and evil (Heb. 5:14), just like a child begins to understand and adhere to the dos and don'ts of his/her family and community. God wants to see me grow out of gullibility (Ephesians 4:14) to looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith (Hebrews 12:2). He wants to see that I become acquainted and very responsive to His voice and words. He wants to know if I can now engage people for me and on His behalf (with my identity) and not Him having to answer for me every time. He wants to see that I now understand the import of His discipline and not become recalcitrant. 

It's a journey! Never in an instant! He definitely, like a responsible parent, provides all the nutrients and attention. Will I accept what He brings to my table? Will I pay attention to His attention to me? Am I growing? Is my growth becoming stunted? Am I beginning to need a Specialist? 

One more thing! Oh, the joy of a responsible parent whose child grows to become another responsible parent (Hebrews 5:12). Are you growing???Â
