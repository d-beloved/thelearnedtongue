What should be the contents of our meetings with the Lord? One major mistake we make is to relegate our times with God to a time of self-condemnation and request-making. How will you feel if a particular friend is always asking for one thing or the other or constantly apologizing every time you meet?

Asking for forgiveness with repentance is very important in our walk with God, especially as soon as the Holy Spirit rebukes us. However, if you always have to wait till it's "prayer time" before you do that, or you frequently see God as an accuser, something is wrong. The devil is the accuser of the brethren, not God. Rev. 12:10

It's not bad to make our needs known to the Father, in fact, He's told us to ask and keep asking until our joy is full. John 16:24. How happy do you think a father will be if all his child does is to ask and ask? There's a place for asking, but much more, there's a place of sincere fellowship.

So many things we ask for would be done even before we ask if we choose to enjoy fellowship. In fact, we get to discover that so many things we ask for are a show of our ignorance. **And ignorance is cured with true fellowship with the Lord in Word and Prayer.**

What is your fellowship with God like? It is beyond routinely muttering some words in the morning, or religiously going through a devotional. It is not about vain repetitions or taking certain positions. Fellowshipping with God is communing with Him; hearing Him and responding appropriately. 

**His Presence should not be about you, it must first be about Him.** Matt.6:33. Spend more time worshipping God with your life, songs, and words. Be eager to know Him more than before. Don't be so consumed with your inadequacies, weaknesses, or needs, that you forget that your relationship with God is meant to be a **love relationship**. Like David, we are meant to constantly say,

Psalm 42:1-2: *As the hart pants and longs for the water brooks, so I pant and long for You, O God. My inner self thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?*
