One of the evidences of fellowshipping rightly with the Lord is that your thoughts begin to align with His. He that is joined with the Lord is one spirit with Him (I Cor. 6:17). What consistent fellowship does is to bring the reality of our oneness with God in the spirit to our souls.

The soul (intellect, will, and emotions) begins to savor the things of God. It becomes more tuned to hearing and doing God's will. It becomes enabled to receive and give life to men around. This is what brings transformation to the life of any man. This transformation never ends! You must get better by the day.

Rom. 12:2: *Do not be conformed to this world (this age), \[fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs], but be transformed (changed) by the \[entire] renewal of your mind \[by its new ideals and its new attitude], so that you may prove \[for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect \[in His sight for you].*

Have you seen several people who are born-again, even pray in tongues, but their lifestyles (thoughts, actions, and feelings) are in contrast to what they profess? The soul is still very crude. They've disallowed the life of God in their spirit from flowing out to their souls. As our souls begin to align with the Lord's, we'll discover that we no longer enjoy anything that has an iota of iniquity, no matter how generally accepted it is. A good relationship with God and iniquity do not work together.

Yes, we were not saved by works, and at the point of salvation, Jesus became our righteousness. But, won't it be strange for an orange tree to start bringing forth lemon? Even though both are citrus fruits, yet, it is inappropriate to see that and overlook it. We can't claim we have the righteousness of God and keep living in sin.

Heb. 1:9: *You have loved righteousness \[You have delighted in integrity, virtue, and uprightness in purpose, thought, and action] and You have hated lawlessness (injustice and iniquity). Therefore God, \[even] Your God (Godhead), has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions.*

The scripture above was said about Jesus, but it also applies to us. Remember that our goal is to be conformed to the image of the Son. Rom.8:29. So, **if the Son was said to have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, then we must.** Nothing works by our ability here in the Kingdom, thus, it's as you fellowship with Him and yield to Him that you get energized to indeed love righteousness and hate iniquity.

Right and consistent fellowship with God can't be overemphasized. It's our ticket to being transformed. It's our key to living pleasurable lives to God. It's the sure foundation to being a vessel unto honor in the hands of the Father. Giving the right priority to fellowship with the Lord begins to define the things we do, the movies we see, the friends we keep, the words we say, the meetings we attend, etc. 

What influences your decisions and actions? And what do you choose at every point? It's important to always choose righteousness! For **righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people**. Prov.14:34
