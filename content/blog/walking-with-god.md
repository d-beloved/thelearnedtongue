The word "walk" refers to advancing by steps. Walk is usually at a steady pace; one step at a time.

**Walking with God is advancing in steps with Him**. It starts from the point of salvation, (Rom. 10:9-10) and never stops until the end (whether corporate/personal) comes.

The point of salvation isn't the peak of our walk with God. Rather, it's the beginning of a journey that entails a step-by-step approach.

**One basic ingredient that is required to aid our walk with God is AGREEMENT**. Amos 3:3. Two cannot walk together except they agree! Agreement signifies harmony of opinion, action, or character. **The more we agree with God, the more progressive and sweeter our walk becomes.**

**One major proof of how far you've come (your walk) with God is how well you are being led by the Spirit**. Being led by the Spirit comes to being as a result of **constant, consistent, and effective communion with the Father**. After salvation, it's expected that whoever will truly advance in steps with God must begin to learn to be led by the Spirit. Rom. 8:14. You can't be led by someone you've not known or understood. Thus, times spent in personal prayers (including worship) and studying of the Word are major assets that can grant us access into the mind of God; helps us know more about God and His ways. You can't claim to walk with someone without having spent some of your time. The more time you spend with God, the more steps you both take together, and the more the bond between you and Him grows. Psalm 42

Lastly, our daily living portrays how well we've advanced in steps with God. How do you live your life? What informs your choices and decisions? What are the motives for doing what you do? These are all pointers to what you believe, i.e. your walk with God. Matt. 7:16-20, Gal. 5:22-23, James 2:17-18.
