*Let us then **fearlessly** and **confidently** and **boldly** draw near to the throne of grace (the throne of God’s unmerited favor to us sinners), that we may receive mercy \[for our failures] and find grace to help in good time for every need \[appropriate help and well-timed help, coming just when we need it].* Hebrews 4:16

Adam and Eve sinned and the next thing they thought of was to hide from God. Judas Iscariot sinned and suicide was his next line of action. Saul sinned, was unruffled, and just sought for a cover to preserve his respect as a king. The children of Israel sinned again and again and only sought God’s help when they were oppressed physically. However, David sinned, and instead of wearing the cloak of a king, he mercifully asked to be punished by God Himself rather than fall into the hand of men.

What brought the difference?

My husband and I were discussing and we came to a conclusion that at every point of sin (a mistake, disobedience, laziness, procrastination, anger, bitterness, etc.), the devil will always draw up a chasm (a mirage actually) between us and God. In summary, the devil creates fear in us by reason of guilt. That fear, which the Bible says has torment, makes us believe that God will be presently unreachable and leads us further away from God. There is an understanding that we must carry at such a time... This understanding is what brought about a different reaction from David. 

Though we are frail and can take some wrong steps at one point or another, we must maintain and continue progress by never holding back to reach out to our Senior brother (Jesus Christ). That you got corrected when you took the wrong step by God via your conscience, His word, or people around is a confirmation that **You're a child of God.** Only bastards get no correction according to the book of Hebrews. So why allow the devil via guilt or pride or self-esteem to hold you back from seeking redress from your Father, my Father?

Yes, discipline comes... But just like in David's case, discipline is meant to draw us closer to the Father and not away from Him.

The words are **fearlessly**, **confidently**, and **boldly**.

Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound, God forbid! But what should be our response when we err...

Go fearlessly, confidently, and boldly to your Father and receive mercy and find grace to help you at that time of need. Don't let it linger, lest it becomes the access of the devil into your life. Go now! Go immediately! Seek Him! He's always looking out for you! The Father of the prodigal was more eager to receive the prodigal than the prodigal was to go back to the Father.

Fearlessly, Confidently, and Boldly!!!

I'll end with this...

*My little children, I am telling you this so that you will stay away from sin. But if you sin, there is someone to plead for you before the Father. His name is Jesus Christ, the one who is all that is good and who pleases God completely.* I John 2:1

The Lord is your help! Don't allow the enemy to take advantage of you! Don't sit where we have fallen, arise again and shine! And you will remain a dear child in the hands of the Father.
