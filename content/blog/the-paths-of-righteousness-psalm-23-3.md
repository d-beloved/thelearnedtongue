*He refreshes and restores my life (my self); He leads me in the paths of righteousness \[uprightness and right standing with Him‚Äînot for my earning it, but] for His name‚Äôs sake.* Psalm 23:3

Let's define/explain some terms we'll be using tonight:
Restore: to turn back ({hence} away) transitively or {intransitively} literally or figuratively (not necessarily with the idea of a return to the starting point); generally to retreat; (Strong's concordance)
Soul: Gen. 2:7
Righteousness: the right ({natural} moral or legal); also (abstractly) equity or (figuratively) prosperity: (Strong's concordance)

There are 3 things worthy of note from that verse:

1. **A refreshing/restoring of the soul is necessary before it can be led in the paths of righteousness.**

   Our initial soul configuration was lost when Adam fell... but we got the key to full restoration when we got born again. However, it is not an instant noodle. David said, "Restores," meaning that it is continuous... Restoration is necessary when we wander away like the prodigal, leaving the truth we know, disobedient, or falter like the disciples that slept off when they should pray, or James and John that wanted to rain down fire, and Jesus told them that was not their configuration, etc.

   The configuration of our hearts/souls dictates how we will recognise the leading of the Lord and how well we will be able to follow through or obey. This is confirmed by Psalm 139:23-24
   *Search me \[thoroughly], O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there is any wicked or hurtful way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.*

   Every time you sense a shift, every time the Holy Spirit prompts you about a faltering or wandering away...quickly attend to His voice. This helps your conscience (your spirit's voice) remain sensitive and active.
2. **Only God knows the paths of righteousness and how to walk in them. That's why He has to LEAD.**


   *For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord.* Isaiah 55:8

   You can't correctly discern what is right in all and at all times if you continue to lean on your understanding (Prov. 3:5-6). And how will you not lean on your understanding? Pray, Study the Bible, and Meditate on God's words.

   *I will instruct you (says the Lord) and guide you along the best pathway for your life; I will advise you and watch your progress.* Psalm 32:8

   How?
   ‚úçüèæwhat to say,
   ‚úçüèæwhat to do,
   ‚úçüèæwhere to go,
   ‚úçüèæwho to walk with,
   ‚úçüèæbig life matters,
   ‚úçüèæsmall life matters, etc  

   **There are ways and there is a way.** "The ways" are inspired by your experiences, environment, people around you, learnings, etc. While the Lord Himself leads you into "THE WAY" for every situation. Will you like to repent of every way you've gone on your own? Ask God for mercy. Tell Him to restore your soul. Then, ask that He will help you look out for, acknowledge, and follow His every lead.
3. **All God does in, for, with, and through you have one goal: His Glory.**


   The reason we can rest assured He will never leave us, He will keep restoring us, and leading us in the paths of righteousness is because of His name's sake. His integrity must be kept! What happens to that name when you refuse to follow? Well, you also bear the consequences! Being a believer means you bear that name and we're expected to bear the name in such a way that brings Him honor. 

   *But God‚Äôs truth stands firm like a great rock, and nothing can shake it. It is a foundation stone with these words written on it: ‚ÄúThe Lord knows those who are really his,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA person who calls himself a Christian should not be doing things that are wrong.‚Äù* 2 Tim. 2:19


   We should continually pray for the grace to bear His name in honour.
